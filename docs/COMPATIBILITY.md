# Compatibility

This public preview is an independent receiver, not an Apple-certified CarPlay accessory. The experimental bundled accessory identity is extractable and its future acceptance is not guaranteed.

| Area | Current scope |
| --- | --- |
| Head unit | Official Android 9+ (API 28+) APK; Android 8 and older are unsupported; Wi-Fi Direct has a firmware-dependent legacy Android 9 path with unverified requested frequency, and modern verified frequency on Android 10+ |
| Phone | Standard, non-jailbroken iPhone with CarPlay enabled; device/iOS compatibility varies |
| Physical evidence | Previous private builds: wired and wireless picture, touch and audio confirmed on the development car with iPhone XS / iOS 18.7.10 |
| Other cars | Mixed community reports across DiLink generations; not a certified model support list |
| 0.2.14 evidence | Automated source/build validation and attributed contributor tests; no new complete-release vehicle test or universal model support is claimed. Earlier DiLink5.1 HUD/hotspot results remain historical evidence. |
| Wi-Fi | Auto uses eligible saved/aligned channels; beside a 5 GHz station, explicit 2.4 GHz precedes other 5 GHz/unpinned default fallbacks. Manual channels stay explicit; no band/performance guarantee. |
| Video | Default H.264 / 30 fps; 60 fps and HEVC increase device-specific demands |

## BYD HUD and car hotspot

See [BYD navigation](BYD_NAVIGATION.md) for the exact verified firmware and lifecycle limits. Earlier car-hotspot builds started CarPlay on the development car using scoped IPv6. Current access-point endpoints prefer usable IPv4 and retain scoped IPv6 fallback. The phone must join the configured car hotspot. Neither result guarantees support on every firmware.

## Android 9 Wi-Fi Direct and experimental features

The Android 9 path creates or reuses a persistent system profile with the public legacy group API, reads generated credentials and uses the firmware channel setter where available. It serializes pinning/cancellation, avoids foreign groups and removes only its owned active group; persistent profiles are not deleted. Unknown setter outcomes stop startup, and unreliable pinning/cleanup should use the manual car hotspot. See [legacy limits](ANDROID9_WIFI_DIRECT.md); the contributor's Redmi K20 Pro result does not validate every BYD Android 9 firmware.

DiLink 3 call controls/dashboard cards and AAC-LC buffered music are independent default-off experiments. They appear in **Settings → Navigation → BYD navigation** (or **Advanced → Advanced vehicle data** when that card is unavailable), and **Advanced → Video and audio** for buffered music. Their corrected source has regression coverage; full call/audio/microphone/restoration and music-interruption acceptance remains device work. DiLink 4 casting/picture fixes describe the tested 2022 Seal setup, not a Qin/Seal-wide guarantee. The Android 13+ hotspot join helper requires strict user-configuration/5 GHz/API/ADB gates and explicit confirmation. See [0.2.14 release notes](RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.14.md).

## Current settings and opt-in limits

**Settings → Display** holds resolution, frame rate, icon/text size, appearance and Interface size; Interface size changes DiPlay controls, not CarPlay geometry. **Audio** holds routing and the ordinary music-buffer choice. **Navigation** holds location/BYD guidance, **Vehicle** holds gestures/wheel keys/car-button controls, **Connection** holds transport/startup/permissions, **Advanced** holds experimental display/media and vehicle data, and **Diagnostics** exports reports.

**Smooth video (experimental)**, **Call echo cancellation (experimental)** and **Clearer call voices (experimental)** are off by default under **Settings → Advanced → Video and audio**. Smooth video adds adaptive pacing delay, can delay touch response, and uses a SurfaceView path without picture adjustments. Changing it reconnects a running session. The call-processing controls apply at the next connection; source/JNI tests do not establish acoustic quality on a car. Optional rotation, split-screen areas and side panel are off by default under **Advanced → Display (experimental)**. Existing opted-in settings are retained during an in-place update.

The specifically observed 1280×480 DiLink 3 projection surface is now recognized by the existing cluster-map path. Actual map output still needs an on-car retest; the measured 1920×720 calibration is not applied to that smaller panel. Narrow USB framing/queue repairs and Bluetooth receive fixes have regression coverage, but they do not establish a fix for every connection report. A charging-only USB port cannot supply the data transport.

## Known limitations

- If the iPhone leaves its current Wi-Fi network but does not join the car hotspot, check that Auto-Join is enabled for that hotspot. If selecting it manually starts CarPlay without a password prompt, record that distinction in the diagnostic report. AP broadcast information elements can affect automatic joining even when credentials and the subsequent CarPlay transport work. See [automatic hotspot joining](WIRELESS_HOTSPOT_JOIN.md) for Apple's documented requirements and a controlled comparison; this does not establish a supported fix for every head unit or iOS version.
- Some units stutter, particularly under higher video load. A 2.4 GHz link alone does not prove the cause: interference, firmware and decoder stalls can all contribute. Try Default icons, 30 fps and a lower resolution, then attach a report.
- For the Wi-Fi channel and the picture size that gave the smoothest result on a BYD Tang, and why, see [Smooth wireless CarPlay](SMOOTH_WIRELESS.md).
- A contributor reported periodic wireless CarPlay stutter on a 2023 Han with GCC DiLink 3 when the car's Wi-Fi client was disconnected: scans every 10 s took the radio off the CarPlay channel for 3-6 s. On Android 10, with network ADB already authorized and the framework transaction available, DiPlay pauses connectivity scans for hotspot/P2P sessions. Same LAN is excluded so station reconnect and roaming remain available. Controller leases share one serial worker; scans restore after the last lease closes. A durable marker precedes suppression, failed restores retry every 30 s while the app runs, and app startup recovers an interrupted restore. A force-stop can delay restoration until the app is opened again. Missing approval or transaction support leaves scans alone. The updated in-app lifecycle needs a parked vehicle retest; without ADB, joining the car to a hotspot also slowed scans in the contributor's test.
- Some iOS/head-unit combinations do not visibly apply icon and text size. Reconnection is implemented; that does not guarantee the iPhone chooses the requested layout.
- A radio that supports joining a 5 GHz network may still reject a 5 GHz Wi-Fi Direct group. The capability flag is diagnostic, not proof of group-owner support.
- Automatic startup depends on the car's firmware and startup permissions.
- USB requires a data port and correct host/device-role behavior.
- Calls, Siri, background reconnection, long journeys and future iOS releases need broader testing.

For a current report, reproduce the problem on **0.2.14**, then open **Settings → Diagnostics → Save diagnostic report**. Android 10+ normally saves to **Downloads/DiPlay**; Android 9 uses a document picker. The confirmation identifies fallback storage and offers **View report** and **Share**. Attach the reviewed `.txt` to a matching [existing issue](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay/issues), or [create an issue](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay/issues/new/choose). Include car/head-unit, Android/DiLink/firmware, iPhone/iOS, connection mode, steps and failure time. Nothing uploads automatically.

Reports record requested frequencies, station association state, fallback failures and remembered-configuration events. Android 10+ can verify the actual group frequency; Android 9 reports its accepted channel request as unverified and system-default as channel 0. Wi-Fi credentials and protocol payloads are excluded. A successful hotspot is not itself a successful CarPlay session.
