# DiPlay next release notes

Changes through DiPlay 0.2.13 are documented in [0.2.13 release notes](RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.13.md). Measured checks are in [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md). Add future unreleased changes here.

## Connection reliability

- USBMUX accepts the bounded protocol-1 diagnostic frame with the four-byte trailer captured in issue #100, including fragmented reads. Recovery still requires a validated preceding reply and a validated next frame; unknown data is rejected. This repairs that captured framing failure, without claiming the entire reported USB connection succeeds.
- Video uses SurfaceView when the attached app window lacks hardware acceleration. Hardware-accelerated windows retain TextureView. Letterboxing, view-area cropping and touch mapping share the same viewport. Picture color adjustments are unavailable on SurfaceView and the controls explain this; saved adjustments remain available for TextureView output.
- Bluetooth checks both RFCOMM streams before starting iAP2 and reports whether reading fails before any bytes arrive. Stream failures preserve their cause and close the socket once. Draining a full receive queue wakes the reader so it can continue.
- USB bulk-IN makes one 16 KiB queue attempt after an explicitly rejected larger request, remembering the smaller size only when it succeeds. Exceptions and timed-out requests are not retried this way. This compatibility path needs an affected-device retest; Android 9 normally supports the original larger sizes.

These changes retain Android 9 / API 28 as the APK minimum. Device acceptance and remaining failure families are tracked in [connection reliability validation](CONNECTION_RELIABILITY.md).
