# Smooth wireless CarPlay

The Wi-Fi channel and the size of the picture can affect how smooth wireless CarPlay feels. The numbers below were measured on a 2024 BYD Tang (DiLink 5.0, 2560×1440 screen) with an iPhone on iOS 27, parked, while scrolling the same Apple Music list. Other cars, firmware and phones may behave differently; interference, scanning and decoder limits can also contribute.

This guide describes 0.2.13 channel-policy and rotation behavior. Wi-Fi Direct is available on Android 9+ with suitable firmware. Android 9 uses the legacy group/channel path and cannot verify the negotiated frequency; see [Android 9 limits](ANDROID9_WIFI_DIRECT.md). Android 10+ retains actual-frequency verification. The contributor measurements below describe their specified Tang setup, not every device.

## 1. Wi-Fi channel

**Settings → Connection setup → Wi-Fi Direct → Preferred channel**

On this Tang, running Wi-Fi Direct on a different 5 GHz channel from the car's joined Wi-Fi network caused:

- the picture stopping for 0.6–2 s at a time;
- music stuttering.

A 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi Direct channel alongside the 5 GHz network was smooth in this test. The result is consistent with radio channel contention, but does not establish the same radio capabilities or cause on every head unit.

- **Auto** (the default) can reuse a compatible saved configuration. Beside an established 5 GHz station connection, it prioritizes an eligible saved frequency or a supported matching station channel, followed by explicit 2.4 GHz attempts before other 5 GHz attempts. An unpinned saved system-default request is deferred in that case. If explicit attempts are rejected, later 5 GHz or system-default fallbacks remain possible; Auto cannot guarantee a band or eliminate contention. Without a station connection, a compatible saved configuration may still be tried before the usual 5 GHz-first fallback order. See the diagnostic report for the verified frequency on Android 10+, or the explicitly unverified requested channel on Android 9.
- If you choose a channel by hand and the car joins a 5 GHz network, try a supported 2.4 GHz channel (1–11), or go back to Auto. Firmware and local regulatory limits still apply.

## 2. Picture size and screen rotation

**Settings → Display and performance → Turn CarPlay with the screen without reconnecting**

Larger pictures can increase encoding, transmission and decoding work. In this test, DiPlay's received and rendered frame rates were close in all three cases, while the larger square arrived at a lower rate. This suggests testing picture size, but does not by itself identify the iPhone encoder as the bottleneck or rule out network effects and backpressure.

| Setting | Picture | Pixels per frame | Frames per second while scrolling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rotation **off** | 2560×1440, the screen's own size | 3.7 million | 45–57 |
| Rotation on, **Smoother (1920)** | 1920×1920 square | 3.7 million | 49–57 |
| Rotation on, **Sharper (the screen's size)** | 2560×2560 square | 6.6 million | 32–44 |

With rotation on, CarPlay gets a square picture that holds both a landscape and a portrait screen. Turning the screen then redraws CarPlay without reconnecting. A 1920 square has exactly as many pixels as a 2560×1440 screen and had a similar frame rate here; equal pixel counts do not guarantee equal performance. It is scaled up on this screen, so text can look softer. A 2560 square has about 1.8 times as many pixels and had a lower frame rate in this test. The actual square size also depends on the selected decoder's capabilities.

**What to choose:**

- **Your screen never turns, or you rarely turn it:** try leaving rotation **off**. That felt smoothest on this Tang and avoids scaling a smaller square up to its screen. If you do turn the screen, CarPlay reconnects at the new size, which took about 10 s on the Tang.
- **You turn the screen often:** turn rotation on and keep **Smoother (1920)**, the default.
- **Sharper (the screen's size):** on a screen wider than 1920 pixels it can request a larger supported square and may reduce smoothness. At 1920 pixels or below, both options have the same size limit.

## 3. Checking it yourself

While CarPlay runs, DiPlay logs a `DiPlay-VideoStats` line every 5 s:

```
video stats rx=56.2fps shown=56.4fps maxGap=73ms kbps=28899 ...
```

- `rx` counts frames received by DiPlay; `shown` counts decoder outputs released for rendering to its surface. These are windowed counters, not proof of every frame the phone sent or every physical display refresh.
- If `shown` keeps up with `rx` but `rx` is low while you scroll, compare picture settings and the Wi-Fi link. The counters alone cannot distinguish phone encoding, transport delays or backpressure, and do not rule out every head-unit problem.
- `maxGap` is the largest interval between received frames shorter than 2 s; longer intervals are excluded. A static screen may also produce gaps because the iPhone need not send new frames. A single large value is not evidence of a stall by itself.
