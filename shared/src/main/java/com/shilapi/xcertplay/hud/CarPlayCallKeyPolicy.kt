 * On DiLink 3 BYD's window manager (PhoneWindowManager.interceptKeyBeforeQueueing) acts on the call keys
 * before any app or accessibility service: the call key (313) still reaches the focused app and the
 * wheel key service, but the hang-up key (314) and the multifunction key (309) reach no app, only BYD's
 * hang-up broadcast (com.byd.btcall.action.CLOSE_BLUETOOTHSETTING with the key code), see [onHangUpBroadcast].
